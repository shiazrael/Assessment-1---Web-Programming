        <h1>Mechanics</h1>
        <p>At its base gameplay, the game puts 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 20-60 second matchmaking and 10–30-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own while securing objectives in order to pressure the opposing team. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle—winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.</p>
