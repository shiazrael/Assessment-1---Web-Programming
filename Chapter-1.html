        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon vegetable oil - plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon liquid ube extract (optional)</li>
        <li>1 block quick melt cheese (165g) - cut into 12 cubes</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons breadcrumbs - for coating</li>
        <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ube powder in a bowl. Pour in hot water and stir until completely rehydrated.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add flour, sugar, and salt. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in warm milk and oil and add the egg and mix. Add the yeast and mix again.</li>
        <li>Add the rehydrated ube and ube extract (if using) and mix well until well combined. It will be very heavy and sticky. Use your hand greased with oil if you have to or use a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Tip the dough on a flat surface. Rub oil to both hands and knead for 7-10 minutes or until soft and smooth. Do the windowpane test to check.</li> 
        <li>Form the dough into a ball and lightly coat with oil. Place it back the large bowl and cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm area and let it rise until it almost doubled in size. Depending on how warm it is, could take 30 minutes to an hour or more.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 equal parts using a knife or dough slicer. Shape a part into a rectangle and then divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Repeat the same with the other half.</li>
        <li>Flatten a ball and place a cube of cheese at the center. Fold the sides of the dough enclosing the cheese cube inside. Form it again into a ball and roll it in breadcrumbs, completely covering all sides.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pieces on a baking sheet living some gaps in between (at least an inch). Leave them to rise for another 30 minutes. While waiting, preheat oven 340° F /170°C. Bake the Ube Pandesal for 20 minutes or until slightly browned. Remove from oven and serve while hot!</li>
        <li>Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
